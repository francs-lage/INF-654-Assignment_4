The CRUD operations is not implemented. I'm working in a different and simple project to see if I can get them working.
I think the problem is that I mixed instructions for an older version of firebase with the 9.0 version.

replaced my first index.html attempt by a basic version that is working.
I'm still not able to put the functions on app.js
